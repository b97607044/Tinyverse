						<h2>Artcoin</h2>
						<p>The currently most used currency - money - was not carefully designed to build a more collaborative society. In fact, it is doing quite the opposite. Artcoin is a project in Tinyverse aiming at developing “Currency for artists”, where we rethink the meaning of money, and work on creating an ecosystem that encourages genuine value exchange through designing a currency designed for artists and their supporters.</p>

									<h2>ARThon</h2>
									<p>Started with a simple though to organise a more accessible Hackathon for artists, ARThon aims at promoting digital infrastructure for bettering art environment and possible collaboration for artists to refine their projects during their creative process. Inspired by projects sprouted from our following ARThons that have raise awareness to several shared issues, we then started Tinyverse, a decentralized autonomous cooperative, aiming to facilitate each project and provide necessary support for when needed. </p>

							<h2>Who we are</h2>
							<p>We are a group of people who choose to work together and contribute our skillsets. In Tinyverse, we form projects as “Keng(坑)”s. It’s a space for people with interest to jump in. We are free to dig a Keng, fill it up, jump into a Keng or jump out from a Keng. In this collaboration culture, people and the trust among people are one of the most important elements. Almost all members have multiple backgrounds, ranging from conceptual art, service design, environmental engineering, finance, math, standup comedy, sound design, civic technology, track and field... and more.</p>

									<h3>Decentralised organising</h3>
									<p>Inspired by Loomio and Ensiral, two digital platforms who are consciously exploring how non-hierarchical organisation can happen, we also believe in empowering all members and strive to create a structure with no hierarchy. Some principle elements here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nPWpfK6KlQNrEnJRf68gr2L935HQVkOz85nILkG2TVE/edit#slide=id.g1e181afa1c_0_1" target="_blank">on eight patterns that should be followed for decentralised organising</a>. </p>

									<h3>Give more than take</h3>
									<p>In every workplace, there are three basic kinds of people: givers, takers and matchers. Organizational psychologist <a href="https://www.ted.com/search?q=are+you+a+giver+or+a+taker">Adam Grant</a> breaks down these personalities and offers simple strategies to promote a culture of generosity and encourage a team with more <a href="https://www.lemonade.com/blog/psychology-givers-takers-matchers-2/">otherish givers. </a></p>

									<span class="icon solid major fa-question"></span>
									<h3>Dare to ask for help</h3>
									<p>To be a successful giver, it is actaully important to ask for help! Asking for help comes with some surprising benefits. Asking a friend or coworker for help gives them the opportunity to be a giver, but also makes them feel good and smart. It does take some courage to do so, and in Tinyverse we encourage that.</p>

									<h3>Recursive public</h3>
									<p>"A recursive public is a public that is constituted by a shared concern for maintaining the means. of association through which they come together as a public." – Christopher Kelty. <br> In Tinyverse we keep and always updated rough consensus whoch could be changed anytime.</p>

									<h3>Be nobody</h3>
									<p>When asking why nobody is doing it. Be that nobody. Borrowing this call to action from g0v, the largest civic tech community in Taiwan, which is famous for their movement to "fork the government."</p>
